# Image-to-Pencil-Sketch-with-Python

pencilSketch
It uses python openCV library to generate a pencil sketch from a photo. The steps followed are,

1.Read the input image as gray scale image
2.Remove any noise using a 3x3 gaussian filter
3.Create a negative image
4.Detect the edges from both image & its negative using Sobel
5.Merge these two edge images -> These two images reinforces some edges and complements some edges -> Alternatively, these two images can be blended with different weights
6.Invert the blended image to get black sketch on white background
7.Show the image and wait for a keystroke to close the display.
